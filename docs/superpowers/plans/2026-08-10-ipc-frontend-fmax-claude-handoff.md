# IPC, cache, and FMax handoff to Claude

**Frozen:** 2026-08-10

**Core worktree:** `/home/qwertyoruiop/m68k-core-040-ooo-worktrees/agent-01`

**Branch:** `codex/ipc-dcache-vipt`

**Frozen RTL checkpoint:** `cc22cd0` (`frontend: skip plans for stale fetch issues`)

This is the continuation point after the IPC/cache pipeline push and its first
cumulative frontend FMax recovery passes.  The design is functionally healthy,
area is healthy, and the remaining work is now principally timing recovery plus
the explicitly listed integration/verification items.  Do not discard the
landed timing cuts merely because a later route exposes a different limiting
cone: each measured cut removed its intended family and the cumulative design
is still smaller than the first five-ID frontend checkpoint.

## 1. Start here

```bash
cd /home/qwertyoruiop/m68k-core-040-ooo-worktrees/agent-01
git status --short --branch
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Expected tracked state is clean at the documentation handoff commit immediately
above `cc22cd0`.  The following are local evidence or reservation files and must
not be committed:

- `.agent-reservation`
- `iter_100_CongestedCLBsAndNets.txt`
- `iter_120_CongestedCLBsAndNets.txt`
- `synth/archive/`
- `synth/fullcore_congested_nets.txt`

The last functional gate is green:

```text
make SBT=~/sbt/bin/sbt test-fast
147 passed / 147 total, 156 suites
```

The last focused frontend gate is `FetchDirectedFtbSpec` 15/15.  A deliberate
negative mutation that restored predictor lookup for born-stale commands failed
at the intended `staleLookupFire` assertion, then the restored RTL passed.

## 2. Non-negotiable rules and goals

- Architecture is binding.  Amend the owning design specification before RTL.
- Plugins communicate only through `host[Service]` or documented `Global` keys.
  Every `Global` key has exactly one producer.  Prefer a service for the next
  ROB-to-frontend control cut; do not reach into ROB internals from FetchAlign.
- Keep bundles plain SpinalHDL types.  Fix tests rather than weakening bundles.
- Reserve an isolated workspace for new work.
- Run `make SBT=~/sbt/bin/sbt test-fast` before handoff.  PM-serialize full
  Verilator runs.
- Tests are meant to reveal defects.  Throughput tests must count real fires,
  associations, results, and non-vacuity conditions, not merely valid pulses.
- Timing target remains 250 MHz (4.000 ns), even though 200 MHz is the present
  deployment floor.  Preserve as much headroom as possible.
- Area growth is not an automatic rejection.  Report it and its source before
  considering removal.  Present area is excellent.
- The user explicitly accepts cumulative cuts that are worthwhile in isolation
  even when one cut alone does not close timing.
- Keep TLBs shallow.  They are CAM-heavy; throughput came from tagged/elastic
  interfaces, banking, and latency overlap, not added entries or lookup copies.

## 3. Landed architecture

| Block | Current hot-path contract | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| FetchAlign + L1I | Three-cycle resident hit, II=1; depth-three tagged fetch ring turns over on response | Sequential resident hits feed bubble-free after fill |
| I-side prefetch | Five total AXI IDs: ID0 precise demand, IDs1-4 same-page sequential lines | Cross-ID responses may complete out of order; one install pipe preserves cache-array ownership |
| L1I/ITLB | True VIPT: virtual set/offset BRAM read starts in parallel with ITLB lookup | Physical tag/permission qualifies the registered read; no ITLB result on BRAM enable |
| DTLB/LSU/L1D | Tagged registered changed-VPN DTLB hits at II=1; VIPT probe and translation launch together | The returned PA qualifies the original L1D read; the hard test requires `useEarlyProbe` for every hit |
| DTLB geometry | 32 entries, four ways, two banks, one walker | No second CAM, no hit-under-miss, no extra walker |
| Store queue/L1D | Independent send/ack cursors; committed non-precise COPYBACK hits pipeline through S0-S3 | Store miss, WT/inhibited, precise, and maintenance remain ordering barriers |
| Slow ALU | SHIFT/BITFIELD pipeline accepts at II=1 | Flush poisons all stages; IQ forecasts fixed-path capacity |
| Integer multiply | Integrated CPLX multiplier accepts at II=1 | Four DSP48E2s with AREG=2, BREG=2, MREG=1, PREG=1; no LUT multiplier |
| Divider | Iterative and one-at-a-time | This is an intentionally hard/area-expensive pipeline candidate, not a hidden hot-path FSM |

Cold or serialized mechanisms that remain reasonable include DTLB/ITLB page
walks, cache refills/evictions, maintenance, precise/MMIO stores, split-access
replay, iterative division, and exception-frame sequencing.  Do not mechanically
pipeline these without preserving ordering, fault, and flush semantics.

  described in section 5.

## 4. Pinned IPC results

Use the ledger
`.superpowers/sdd/progress-ipc-push-2026-08-09.md` as the detailed source.  Do
not compare aggregates with different kernel sets or old unpinned `/tmp` logs.

| Workload | Before | Current | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Independent ALU, ideal memory | about 292 cycles / 1.464 IPC | 214.3 cycles / **1.998 IPC** | Reaches the two-wide floor |
| Independent ALU, `l2:5:70` | 1129 cycles / 0.379 IPC | 276 cycles / **1.552 IPC** | 4.10x fewer cycles than the serialized-I-side state |
| Complete 11-kernel aggregate, ideal | prior three-seed total 22,909 cycles / 0.6741 IPC | 7,619 / 7,648 / 7,649 cycles / **0.6739 IPC** | Three-seed total +7 cycles; neutral |
| Complete 11-kernel aggregate, `l2:5:70` | prior three-seed total 34,378 cycles / 0.4492 IPC | 9,491 / 9,441 / 9,325 cycles / **0.5465 IPC** | Three-seed cycles -17.8%, IPC +21.7% |
| COPYBACK store stream, ideal | 1,814 cycles / 0.269 IPC | 601 cycles / **0.812 IPC** | 3.02x |
| COPYBACK store stream, `l2:5:70` | 1,992 cycles / 0.245 IPC | 779 cycles / **0.626 IPC** | 2.56x |

The old independent-ALU collapse under `l2:5:70` was instruction starvation,
not ALU execution: a one-outstanding 16-byte I-side request repeatedly paid the
70-cycle line-service latency.  Five distinct 64-byte requests now cover that
latency.  The remaining gap from 1.552 to 2.0 is cold/redirect/miss-window and
finite-buffer behavior rather than an ALU issue bottleneck.

## 5. Pinned physical results

All figures use the 4.000 ns constraint.  A negative WNS therefore gives
`FMax = 1000 / (4.000 - WNS)` MHz.

| Checkpoint | Default route | WNS / FMax | TNS / failing endpoints | Routed area | What it proved |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `2c7c544` five-ID base | both pblocks | -3.633 ns / 131.010 MHz | -61,194.376 / 59,598 | 113,298 LUT, 50,508 FF | First functional prefetch checkpoint; top 100 were `ringPlanSeq` |
| `3c4e1f8` token cut | decode only | **-2.720 ns / 148.810 MHz** | -38,486.906 / 51,523 | 114,741 LUT | Removes functional sequence association; result reproduced bit-for-bit from same DCP |
| `dc16fc1` redirect cut | decode only | -3.135 ns / 140.154 MHz | -40,968.956 / 47,952 | 111,555 LUT, 50,366 FF | Removes ROB doFlush/exception family and about 3k LUT; exposes `ringStale` |
| `cc22cd0` stale-plan cut | decode only | **-3.326 ns / 136.500 MHz** | **-43,658.238 / 46,278** | **113,642 LUT, 50,416 FF, 26 BRAM, 4 DSP** | Removes all `ringStale` paths; exposes remote ROB `coreHalted` quiesce family |

The current synthesis result is WNS -2.659 ns.  Route is clean, with no hold or
pulse-width failures.  Current utilization is only 52.38% of device LUTs, 5.42%
of BRAM tiles, and 0.22% of DSPs.  The cumulative route remains 1,099 LUTs below
the reproducible token-cut route.  Area is not a problem.

### Floorplan result

The four same-DCP `3c4e1f8` routes were:

| Mode | WNS / FMax | TNS | Failing endpoints |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| none | -3.162 ns / 139.626 MHz | -48,919.734 | 63,028 |
| decode | **-2.720 ns / 148.810 MHz** | **-38,486.906** | **51,523** |
| dcache | -3.648 ns / 130.753 MHz | -52,409.535 | 59,696 |
| both | -2.804 ns / 146.972 MHz | -46,685.883 | 60,324 |

`decode` is now the default and reproduced exactly.  The broad D-cache pblock is
disabled by default because it is locally overfull, captured an unrelated ROB
carry chain through flattened-name matching, and was worse than no floorplan.
Keep all four controls for diagnosis.  Do not widen the X87 decode box: a prior
X103 experiment regressed.  Capture-filter cleanup should be its own exact-DCP
A/B.  FetchAlign/Icache are not actually members of the decode pblock, so do not
attribute an unplaced frontend cone improvement to that pblock without route
coordinates.

### Archived evidence

- `synth/archive/dc16fc1_internal_redirect_decode/`
- `synth/archive/cc22cd0_stale_plan_decode/`

The current archive contains the exact generated Verilog, synthesized and
routed DCPs, MD5, Vivado log, timing/utilization/slack/congestion/fanout/path and
pblock reports.  Current generated-netlist MD5:
`9ceebf788ec66393a3458eecafb4d255`.

## 6. Exact next FMax cut

Every one of the current routed top-100 paths begins at
`RobPlugin_logic_coreHalted_reg/C` and ends in FetchAlign/Icache control.  The
worst ends at `IcachePlugin_logic_lineReg[152]/CE`, is 7.220 ns / 23 levels, and
is 70.25% routing.  The next cut should terminate this remote halt state at a
frontend register without adding a cycle or allowing one last fetch.

### 6.1 Amend the frontend/STOP contract first

Update the binding frontend/architecture documentation to define an exact
ROB-owned frontend-quiesce service.  The service should expose the current
active state for observation and the exact next state for local capture.  Do not
add a `Global` key.  The sole producer is `RobPlugin`.

The state equations to mirror are:

```text
stopEnter = sysTriggerSig && p0.sysKind == STOP
stoppedNext = (stopped || stopEnter) && !interruptPending
fatalNext = coreHalted || coreHaltedIn
frontendQuiesceNext = stoppedNext || fatalNext
```

The interrupt-clear priority must match ROB exactly.  Recheck the live code
before copying these expressions; if ROB state priority changes, update both the
spec and service equation rather than relying on this handoff text.

### 6.2 Implement through a service, not plugin internals

1. Add a plain directionless `FrontendQuiesceService` in `services/Services.scala`.
2. Make `RobPlugin` its sole producer.
3. In FetchAlign, capture
   `fetchQuiesced := RegNext(frontendQuiesceNext) init(False)`.
4. Replace every existing functional `quiesce` use with the local registered
   copy.  Keep response/ring draining alive while halted.
5. Add a simulation assertion that the local value equals ROB's visible
   `(stopped || coreHalted)` after reset.  This is an induction proof: both are
   loaded from the same next-state expression on the same edge.
6. Remove the direct top-level assignment
   `fetchAlign.quiesce := rob.stopped || rob.coreHalted` only after every harness
   and synth integration is updated.

A plain `RegNext(stopped || coreHalted)` is incorrect.  It would leave
`ic.cmd.fire` and/or `feed.fire` possible for one cycle after the ROB-visible
halt state asserts.  If exact next-state capture cannot be cleanly expressed,
the safe fallback is assert-exact and clear-late, accepting one wake bubble;
never assert-late.

### 6.3 Non-vacuous tests

- STOP entry: no fetch command or decode feed on the first cycle `stopped` is
  visible.
- STOP interrupt wake: local quiesce clears on the exact ROB wake edge and the
  redirect target is the first subsequent fetch.
- Fatal diagnostic halt: asserts on the exact visible edge and never clears.
- Hold a live C+1 FTB result over halt entry: no apply, FTQ push, target hold,
  cache command, or feed escapes.
- Outstanding I-cache responses continue to drain/discard while quiesced; no
  ring deadlock.
- Backpressure both `ic.cmd.ready` postures and expose/count real fires.
- Mutate to delayed-active and require the first-cycle test to fail.
- Assert the local/frontend and ROB-visible halt bits remain cycle-identical.

Run the focused tests, the mandatory fast gate, then regenerate and route before
claiming an FMax improvement.  Keep the cut even if it exposes the next family,
provided its semantics, mutation proof, and area are sound.

## 7. Likely following cut, only after recensus

Before the current route, synthesis exposed a related 25-level
`FetchAlign.stalled -> Icache.lineReg` family.  If it becomes the routed limiter
after local quiesce, split unobserved command payload selection from the late
hard valid/fire veto:

```text
H = stalled || fetchQuiesced || faultHold
E = FTB plan eligibility without H
applyNow = E && !H                    // architectural state remains exact
C = started && ringSlotAvailable && ibufRoomForCmd
M = H || ftqMismatch
acceptNoVeto = C && ic.cmd.ready
issFire = acceptNoVeto && !M
```

Drive command-only PC/drop payload muxes from `E`, but keep FTQ/ring/target
architectural mutations on `applyNow` and every observed issue side effect on
`issFire`.  Assert `issFire == ic.cmd.fire`.  This is safe only because the
I-cache/ITLB `ready` contract is independent of `cmd.valid`; preserve and assert
that assumption.  Under a veto the payload is unobserved, but valid/fire must
stay low.  Do not implement this speculatively if the post-quiesce route points
elsewhere.

## 8. Why the three current frontend cuts stay

- `3c4e1f8` replaced live dynamic sequence equality with a local fixed-C+1
  association and assertion-only provider tokens.  It improved the first
  measured route materially and removed the `ringPlanSeq` family.
- `dc16fc1` lets registered internal redirect application occur physically and
  relies on same-edge flush/stale priority to kill it.  It removed the measured
  doFlush/exception family and reduced mapped LUTs by about 3,000.
- `cc22cd0` suppresses FTB/gshare lookup for cache commands already known to be
  born stale.  It removed the entire `ringStale` top-100 family.  Its isolated
  WNS is worse only because the next remote halt cone is now exposed.

Reverting any of these restores a previously measured limiter.  Continue
cutting the newly exposed registered control cones instead.

## 9. Synthesis recipe

Generate the exact full-core RTL, then run the default decode floorplan:

```bash
~/sbt/bin/sbt 'runMain m68k040.top.GenFullCoreSynthVerilog'
vivado -mode batch -nojournal \
  -log synth/<descriptive-name>.log \
  -source synth/impl_FullCore.tcl
```

`synth/impl_FullCore.tcl` enforces the 4.000 ns target and accepts
`FLOORPLAN_MODE={none,decode,dcache,both}`.  Default is `decode`.  Before a new
run, pin the exact HEAD and generated-Verilog MD5 in the ledger.  Archive both
DCPs, generated Verilog, log, and reports before regenerating.  Report WNS,
TNS, failing endpoints, hold/PW status, LUT/FF/BRAM/DSP, top-path family, logic
levels, route percentage, and floorplan occupancy.  A synthesis-only WNS is an
early signal, not a substitute for the route gate.

## 10. Separate work not on this branch

### Debug controller design

No debug/JTAG RTL exists in the Spinal core yet.  A design-only addendum is
committed separately:

```text
worktree: /home/qwertyoruiop/m68k-core-040-ooo-worktrees/agent-02
branch:   codex/debug-ctrl-jtag-design
commit:   843249d docs: specify JTAG-compatible debug controller
```

It preserves the deployed sibling `macqd700-soc` contract: debug base
`0x5090_0000`, AXI-Lite local map, append-only discovery at `0x0A0`, exact
macro-level halt/step, halted-only architectural/cache operations, explicit
CDC/reset ownership, and shared cache-maintenance arbitration.  Review/cherry-
pick the spec before any RTL.  Do not invent a second maintenance producer or
copy `BackendWiringPlugin`'s internal-reaching pattern.

### SoC five-ID fabric support

The platform-side crossbar/L2 support is ready in another repository:

```text
worktree: /home/qwertyoruiop/macqd700-soc-worktrees/soc-if-outstanding
branch:   agent/soc-if-outstanding
commits:  bf6c859 afcc0cb 4a9d608 4079649
```

It accepts five distinct live CPU-IF IDs by default, blocks a duplicate or sixth,
routes all multibeat responses by RID, permits cross-ID completion reorder, and
retains legacy behavior for other masters/targets.  Gates: AXI xbar 422/0, L2C
31/0, L2C chain 4/0 with eight ARs before first R, VRAM chain 14/0, all eight
lint configurations green.

The remaining SoC integration blocker is the current CPU wrapper/`if_to_axi`:
it is still one-outstanding, fixed-ID, and emits 16-byte ARLEN=0 requests.  The
core and fabric service contracts are ready, but the wrapper/submodule bump must
carry five distinct IDs and 64-byte ARLEN=3 lines before hardware exercises the
new concurrency.

## 11. Remaining correctness/verification debt

- Debug RTL/host integration is unimplemented; only the design addendum exists.
- SoC CPU wrapper integration is required for real five-ID instruction traffic.
- Iterative DIV is still single-outstanding.  Replication/unrolling is an area
  trade, not a cheap pipeline-register insertion.
- There is no current FPU RTL.  The updated FPU specs require fixed-latency
  DSP-backed FADD/FMUL paths to be elastic/II=1 and allow FDIV/FSQRT to remain
  iterative; follow the spec before implementation.
- Continue exact flush/ROB-ID reuse, fault, permission, split-page, maintenance,
  miss-barrier, and output-collision tests whenever a queue becomes multi-flight.
- Do not deepen either TLB as a throughput shortcut.  Measure CAM cost and prove
  need first.
- The present FMax is far below both 200 and 250 MHz.  This is expected after the
  large IPC changes, but it is now the principal core task.

## 12. Definition of the next successful handoff

The next phase is successful when it has:

1. a spec-first, service-clean, cycle-exact local frontend-quiesce cut;
2. directed mutation-proven halt/wake/drain tests;
3. the mandatory fast gate green;
4. an exact generated-netlist MD5 and archived synthesis/route evidence;
5. a top-path recensus showing the `coreHalted` family gone;
6. honest WNS/TNS/failing-endpoint and area deltas, even if 250 MHz is not yet
   closed; and
7. a decision based on the newly exposed family, not a reflexive rollback of
   cumulative, verified cuts.
